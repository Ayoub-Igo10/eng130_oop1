### What is OOP?:
```commandline
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic.

```
### What are the 4 Pillars?:
```commandline
- Abstraction.
- Encapsulation.
- Inheritance.
- Polymorphism.
```
### OOP Benefits:
```commandline
- Modularity for easier troubleshooting
- Reuse of code through inheritance
- Effective problem solving

```
### Functionality of each pillar:
```commandline
- Abstraction: 
To abstract something away means to hide away the implementation details inside something – sometimes a prototype, sometimes a function. So when you call the function you don't have to understand exactly what it is doing.

- Encapsulation:
Encapsulation means that each object in your code should control its own state. State is the current "snapshot" of your object. The keys, the methods on your object, Boolean properties and so on. 

- Inheritance:
Reusability is the main benefit here. We know sometimes that multiple places need to do the same thing, and they need to do everything the same except for one small part. This is a problem inheritance can solve.

- Polymorphism
Polymorphism means "the condition of occurring in several different forms." That's exactly what the fourth and final pillar is concerned with – types in the same inheritance chains being able to do different things.
